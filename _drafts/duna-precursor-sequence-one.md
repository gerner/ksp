Duna Mission Sequence One (Sequence One), will be the first to actually be
sent to Duna. Additionally, they will be the first interplantary missions for
Gerner Space Program (GSP). These missions will be a combination of space travel
experimentation and initial Duna system exploration.

Sequence Objectives
-------------------

* Design, build, launch multiple unmanned vehicles to Duna planetary system
* Determine desired flight path parameters for Duna intercept, and insertion,
  including aerobreak/aerocapture
* Successfully perform necessary intercept, insertion, escape and landing
  manuvers with at least two vehicles
* Measure Duna and Ike planetary parameters (atmosphere, gravity, etc.)
* Survey Duna and Ike for resources
* Collect and return resource samples from Duna and Ike
* Gain experience with manned spaceflight in the Kerbin planetary system

Sequence Prerequisites
----------------------

Before Sequence One can begin, it's critical that GSP staff have the necessary
equipment, experience and expertise. To that end we've identified a number of
specific prerequisites for Sequence One.

* Develop interplanetary probes capable of Duna intercept, insertion and Kerbin
  return
* Develop Duna and Ike landers capabile of long-term stay on surface
* Determine optimal Minmus intercept and Kerbin return flight path, including
  aerobrake/aerocapture
* Test launch all equipment for all Sequence One missions
* Successfully launch and return at least two misisons, including at least one
  manned mission to Kerbin's outer moon, Minmus, including aerobrake

Sequence One Missions
---------------------

Before any mission to Duna can be launched, these prerequisites above suggest
at least the following missions:

* S1.prereq.1: Single unmanned probe to Minmus intercept, free-return
  trajectory, land or splash safely on Kerbin
* S1.prereq.2: Unmanned Minmus intercept, insertion and Kerbin return,
  including multiple vehicles to test aerobraking manuvers
* S1.prereq.3: Minmus landing, resource sampling and return
* S1.prereq.4: Manned Minmus intercept, insertion and Kerbin return, including
  aerobraking

The core sequence will tentatively consist of the following missions:

* S1.core.1: a set of probes launched with slightly different flight pathes to
  experiment with aerobraking/aerocapture around Duna
* S1.core.2: a pair of probes with multiple landers for Duna and Ike surface
  measurement. These probes will also survey Ike and Duna for resources.
* S2.core.3: a set of probes launched to Duna for return to Kerbin to
  experiment with Kerbin aerobraking/aerocapture
* S2.core.4: a pair of landers to Duna and Ike to collect resource samples for
  Kerbin return
