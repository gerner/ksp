Goals
-----

In this set of missions, we'll lay the groundwork to achieve the goals in our
first mission sequence. Primarily these goals are around simply sending probes
to Duna and even returning some. To achieve these goals we have a few
pre-requisites:

* Kerbin-system infrastructure to support inter-planetary missions
* RemoteTech communications capabilities and infrastructure to Duna
* Experience and expertise with aerobrake/aerocapture
* Experience and expertise with orbital intercepts with bodies in other orbits

###Kerbin Infrastructure

We've already been establishing a depot in low Kerbin orbit. This depot will
support missions out of LKO.

This is probably enough infrastructure to support our next steps, but I
anticipate sending up some additional modules, or at least some additional
fuel before we achieve all of our immediate goals.

###RemoteTech Communications Infrastructure

We've already built a communications network serving the Kerbin system, but to
launch and control probes to Duna we'll need to unlock antennae that can reach
Duna and build a sattelite network carrying those anntennae.

So we'll need science to unlock the parts necessary and then we'll need to
build a network of sattelites equiped with them.

###Aerobrake

While I have successfully returned one capsule from the Mun with [Deadly
Reentry][deadly-reentry], I did so without any difficult settings. So we'll
need some practice with that in the safety of the Kerbin system.

###Next Steps

To achieve these prerequisites we have some immediate next steps:

1. Gather more science with [SCANSat][scansat] and [Kethane][kethane] probes in
   polar orbits around Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus.
2. Return crew to SciStat with [TAC Lifesupport][tac-lifesupport] supplies, and
   reposition SciStat in Minmus orbit, from Munar orbit.
3. Launch a probe or vehicle to, and return from Minmus, including an
   aerocapture at Kerbin, not straight into reentry.
4. Unlock RemoteTech antennae that can reach Duna from Kerbin and build a
   communication network to do so.

The first two of these steps seems relatively straight forward. The second two
might require more time to properly execute. Certainly the fourth requires
unlocking more science.
