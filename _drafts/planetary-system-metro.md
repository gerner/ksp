While waiting the two days for Vestri I to reach Minmus, Geofwin and Keller
Kerman launched the maiden voyage of the Planetary System Metro (PSM).

Objectives
----------

This mission's goal is three-fold. First, Geofwin will relive Bob Kerman at
Pitstop station in Kerbin orbit. Then Keller will continue in the PSM to the
Mun to relieve Jeb from his Kethane mining mission where he's been harvesting
and refining the resource into rocket fuel for some weeks. Finally Jeb will
return in the PSM to return himself and Bob to KSP.

Planetary System Metro and Launch Vehicle
-----------------------------------------

The PSM is meant to ferry crew within a planetary system as well as land in
vacuum or atmosphere in a variety of gravities.

###Planetary System Metro

<span class="imgcaption">Planetary System Metro in the VAB</span>

Powered by three Rocomax 48-7S engines, the PSM is an efficient transport
within a planetary system. With the Rockomax X200-16 fuel tank, it's capabale
of nearly 2000 m/s of delta-v. The engines are arranged in a cluster about a
central decoupler.

Four LT-2 landing struts, as well as three Mk2-R
radial-mount parachutes should allow the PSM to land successfully in atmosphere
on Kerbin or another planet, or in a low-gravity, vacuum setting (like the Mun,
Minmus, or Ike). That said, a PSM landing has not yet been attempted. Jeb and
Bob Kerman will be the first on their return journey to KSP.

In addition, the PSM carries a [Kerbal Engineer
Redux](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/18230-0-21-1-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v0-6-1-0)
build and flight engineer module (not shown in this picture of an early PSM
variant). The Kerbal Engineer Redux module should provide some of the same
valuable feedback seen in
[MechJeb](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/12384-PART-0-21-Anatid-Robotics-MuMech-MechJeb-Autopilot-v2-0-9)
modules, but without the same extreme level of automation. PSM is also equipped
with a
[Telemachus](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24594-0-21-Telemachus-%E2%80%93-Telemetry-and-Flight-Control-in-the-Web-Browser)
antenna to transmit flight telemetry back to KSP.

###PSM Launch Vehicle

While the PSM's main engines are efficient for manuvers in system, and even
(hopefully) for controlled landing and liftoff in low-gravity, vacuum settings,
they do not provide thrust to weight ratio above one on Kerbin surface. To
reach orbit from Kerbin, the PSM is launched by a
[mass-efficient](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/45155-Mass-optimal-engine-type-vs-delta-V-payload-and-min-TWR),
staged launch vehicle.

![PSM Launch Vechicle Stage 1][vab-psm-stage-1]
<span class="imgcaption">PSM Launch Vehicle Stage 1</span>

Stage 1 of the PSM launch vehicle consists simply of a single Rocomax X200-16
fuel tank and a cluster of three LV-T30 liquid fuel engines. Stage two is
capable of over 2000 m/s of delta-v in atmosphere, and has a TWR of over 1.5 on
Kerbin. Like the PSM, the stage 1 engines are arranged in a cluster around a
central decoupler and modular girder segment, coupling stage 1 to stage 2.

![PSM Launch Vehicle Stage 2][vab-psm-stage-2]
<span class="imgcaption">PSM Launch Vehicle Stage 2</span>

PSM Launch Vehicle Stage 2 is more complex, consisting of a core Rockomax
Jumbo-64 fuel tank and four LV-T30 engines. This core has a TWR of just over 1.
In addition, four asparagus staged boosters fueled by two FL-T800 fuel tanks
and powered by a single LV-T30 engine each. Together with the core these
boosters are able to provide a TR of over 1.5 and over 2000 m/s of delta-v,
nearly enough to achieve orbit. The PSM itself provides the final boost into a
stable orbit.

With no gimbaling available on the LV-T30 engines, and limited torque from the
PSM command module, flight control could be an issue for the launch vehicle.
Four AV-R8 winglet on stage 2 provide stable flight until stage 2 is decoupled,
at which point the remaining mass is controlled by the command module's
reaction wheels.

Launch
------

Standard launch.
Issue after dropping boosters, slight attitude correction. Keller and Geofwin
were not pleased.

Pitstop Relief and Munar Intercept
----------------------------------

On approaching the Mun Station Kellar realizes there's no viable docking port
available. Jeb clearly has not prepared for the transfer. A robotic docking
tugs go into action to reconfigure the modular docking at Mun Station I. Once
reconfigured, Kellar can move in to dock.

After crew transfer, fuel and oxidizer are transferred for the return Jeb's
excited to get home. Kellar a little worried about spending a few weeks doing
the hard work of Kethane mining.


Jeb's Return Flight Home
------------------------

Jeb watches Mun Station I disappear in the distance on the Lazor Cam as he
closes in on the maneuver node. Only need 288 m/s delta-v to get back to
Kerbin, including a plane change (integrated with kerbin intercept burn).
Shoot for periapsis of about 34km to  do aerobraking. Once we're in a stable
orbit we'll aim for KSP touchdown and ultimate recovery.

Goal is to refit, refuel and reuse PSM on future missions. At KSP engineers are
already putting together designs for recovery system capable of transporting
PSM back to KSP.

About 4 hour trip to Kerbin. Set alarm for about 30 minutes to periapsis.
Should be plenty of time to prep for aerobrake maneuver. 30 minutes in plot
maneuver node for retro-burn. Need to kill 844 m/s of orbital velocity. [KSP
aerobrake calculations][http://alterbaron.github.io/ksp_aerocalc/] show we
should be in fine shape with 1443 m/s orbital velocity at 2124km altitude. At
this point, 26 minutes from periapsis.
