Objectives
----------

* Collect additional science from Minmus
* Deliver a sattelite into polar orbit from a vehicle on flyby
* Conduct an aerocapture maneuver, without direct landing

In this mission to Minmus we'll collect our first science from Minums. In
addition, we'll deliver a KeScan sattelite into poloar orbit to begin scanning
the surface and surveying for Kethane. We'll also conduct flyby and aerocapture
maneuvers to practice maneuvers we'll need during our Duna missions.

Mission Plan
------------

The mission will consist of several phases where we'll launch a vehicle into
orbit, burn for minmus intercept, deliver the KeScan sattelite into polar
orbit, scan Minmus on flyby for science, transfer back to Kerbin ultimately
aerobraking at Kerbin into LKO and finally landing back on Kerbin.

###Launch into Kerbin Orbit

The first phase will launch a payload of two vehicles into Kerbin Orbit. These
vehicles are the KeScan sattelite and the Minmus Surveyor. The KeScan sattelite
is a modification on the KeScan I sattelite already in Kerbin orbit.

The Minmus Surveyor cosists of two modules: the service module with fuel and
propulsion capable of burning for a Minmus intercept and flyby, and the science
package which will collect and return various scientific measurements back to
Kerbin.

The launch vehicle itself will be a modification of the KerbStage rocket we've
already used on several other missions. It should have enough delta-V to launch
into orbit, although the final orbital insertion burn will likely be carried
out by the Surveyor service module.

We expect this phase to last several minutes and take around 4500m/s of dV. The
launch vehicle will decouple and burn up in the atmosphere.

###Minmus Transfer

In the second phase the service module will burn for Minmus intercept. This
maneuver will leave the Surveyor on a free-return trajectory, ideally with a
low flyby of Minmus and a low periapsis back at Kerbin. We anticipate this
phase taking around 34 hours. We expect this phase to start with a 900m/s burn
for Minmus intercept.

Prior to the burn, we'll need to make sure to cover Minmus with KerbComm
sattelites.

###Minmus Flyby and KeScan Polar Orbit Injection

This phase will be the most complex of the mission. In addition to performing
science during the flyby, we also need to deliver the KeScan sattelite into
polar orbit. Quite likely we'll face eclipse by Minmus leaving no line of sight
to Kerbin. During the communications blackout we'll only be able to execute a
pre-programmed maneuver. We'll target this maneuver for the polar orbit
injection for the KeScan sattelite. We'll only get one shot at getting this
sattelite into polar orbit.

We'll plan for polar orbit injection should take at least 280m/s of dV. We'll
likely need some later orbit adjustments by the KeScan sattelite. The flyby
itself should last for around 5 hours.


###Kerbin Return

During this final phase we'll likely need to make a course correction to hit
the desired periapsis of roughly 34km. We'll execute this maneuver at apoapsis.
Once complete we'll travel to Kerbin which will take roughly 56 hours.

Before hitting the atmosphere we'll decouple the service module. The objective
with this first aerobrake is to achieve an Apoapsis of around 100km, but
certainly above 70km. This will result in a second aerobrake maneuver which
will land the science package.

The science package carries a heat shield, landing legs, and parachutes to
faciliate the aerobraking and landing.

Resource Requirements
---------------------

Maneuvers:

* Launch: 5000m/s
* Minmus Transfer: 1000m/s
* Polar Orbit Injection: 300m/s
* Kerbin Return: 50m/s

Vechicles:

* Launch Vehicle: 4300m/s (need 4300m/s)
* Minmus Surveyor: 2252m/s (need 1050m/s)
* KeScan: 680m/s (need 300m/s)

Vehicles
--------

###KeScan II

* Full Mass: 1015kg
* Dry Mass: 793kg
* 2x LV-1R: 3kN thrust, 290s Isp
* Delta-V: 687m/s

KeScan II is a reconfigured, more compact version of KeScan I with the addition
of a themometer for making additional scientific measurements.

###Surveyor Science Package

* Mass: 1150kg

The Surveyor science package carries scientific instruments (Science Jr,
Mystery Goo Container, 2HOT Thermometer). On this mission it will make
measurements during the Minmus flyby.

###Minmus Surveyor Service Module

* Full Mass (including payload): 8730kg
* Dry Mass: 4370kg
* LV-909: 50kN thurst, 390s Isp
* Delta-V: 2345m/s

This vehicle will carry the KeScan II and the science package to Minmus
intercept. In addition, it will make any course corrections to get an
aerocapture back at Kerbin.

###Minmus Surveyor Launch Vehicle

* Full Mass (including payload): 54250kg
* Delta-V: 4374m/s
