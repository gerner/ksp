![A KerbComm sattelite][kerbcomm-sattelite]

KerbComm is a constellation of 4 [RemoteTech][1] equipped sattelites around
Kerbin. The KerbComm sattelites should orbit Kerbin such that each sattelite
has line of sight to two other sattelites and at least one KerbComm sattelite
has line of sight to KSC at all times.

Currently they are in similar orbits approximately 90 degrees apart from their
initial launch. However, there are non-trivial differences in their orbital
periods and their relative positions such that one of the KerbComm sattelites
very nearly has no line of sigt to any other KerbComm sattelite. In this
mission we'll regularize positions and match their orbital periods.

Objective
---------

1. Redistribute KerbComm sattelites into equidistant positions
2. Match orbital periods
3. Approximately circularize orbits

Initial Setup and Planned Maneuvers
-----------------------------------

Execute planned manuver using [RemoteTech][1] flight computer.

###KerbComm A

Reference position/orbit. Orbit is right-handed counter-clockwise. Relative
angular position is measured clockwise.

* Orbit: 353787m by 346452m
* Semimajor Axis: 949108m
* Orbital Period: 3091.52s
* Approximate angular position: 0 degrees (reference)

###KerbComm B

* Orbit: 372898m by 325318m
* Semimajor axis: 950358.5m
* Orbital Period: 3097.63s
* Approximate angular position: 75 degrees (target is 90)

Need to increase relative angular position. So increase semimajor axis/orbital
period above those of KerbComm A. Then circularize around ~353km x 346km orbit,
with semimajor axis/orbital period matching KerbComm A.

1. First maneuver: increase Pe to ~347000 with 11.1m/s dV. Semimajor
   axis/orbital period will be 959949/3144.64. Expect short burn ~10s
2. Wait for desired relative angular position is achieved. This is aproximately
   1.6 of KerbComm A's orbits, or 5000s. This is very approximate.
3. Second maneuver: decrease Ap to ~352000 with 10.7m/s dV. Expect Pe to fall by
   <1km. Make final small adjustments, decreaseing semimajor axis to match
   semimajor axis of KerbComm A. Expect short burn 10s.

###KerbComm C

* Orbit: 356063m by 344654m
* Semimajor axis: 950358m
* Orbital Period: 3097.63s
* Relative Angular Position: 183 degrees (target is 180)

Current relative angular position is within tolerances. However, the current
semimajor axis, and therefore the orbital period, is too large.

1. Decrease Ap to 353000 with 1.5m/s dV. Resulting semimajor axis/orbital period
   will be 948827/3090.15. Make final small adjustments, increaseing semimajor
   axis to match KerbComm A. Expect a short burn ~5s.


###KerbComm D

* Orbit: 357219m by 345648m
* Semimajor axis: 951434m
* Orbital Period: 3102.89s
* Relative Angular Position: 285 degrees (target is 270)

Need to decrease relative angular position. So decrease semijaor axis/orbital
period below those of KerbComm A. Then circularize around 357km x 341km orbit
with semimajor axis/orbital period matching KerbComm A.

1. First maneuver: decrease Pe to 320000m with 13.4m/s dV. Resulting Semimajor
   axis/orbital period are 938031.5/3037.56. Expect short burn 10s.
2. Wait for desired relative angular position. This should be approximately
   2.39 of KerbComm A's orbit, or 7380s. This is very approimate.
3. Second maneuver: increase Pe to 341km with ~10m/s dV. Make final small
   adjustments to match semimajor axis to match KerbComm A. Expect short burn
   10s.

Results
-------

![KerbComm final orbits][final-orbits]
<span class="imgcaption">KerbComm final orbits</span>

Final orbital periods look very good. Relative angular positions are within
tolerances. In total we spent about 60m/s of dV, with about 24m/s from KerbComm
B and D and about 12m/s from C. Each sattelite still has more than half its
remaining fuel to maintain its orbit. I expect that this operation will be the
most expensive since initial launch and positioning.

###KerbComm A

* Orbit: 353787m by 346452m
* Semimajor Axis: 949108m
* Orbital Period: 3091.52s
* Approximate angular position: 0 degrees (reference)

###KerbComm B

* Orbit: 351344m by 346806m
* Semimajor axis: 949075m
* Orbital Period: 3091.36s
* Approximate angular position: 83 degrees (target is 90)

###KerbComm C
* Orbit: 353600m by 344741m
* Semimajor axis: 949170.5m
* Orbital Period: 3091.83s
* Relative Angular Position: 183 degrees (target is 180)

###KerbComm D

* Orbit: 357143m by 341102m
* Semimajor axis: 949122.5
* Orbital Period: 3091.59s
* Relative Angular Position: 272 degrees (target is 270)

Takeaways
---------

* LV1 is a very low powered engine, even for an very low mass vehicle. All
  burns were longer than expected.
* Regularity of the orbit has reasonable tolerances as long as period is very
  close. But still, 4 sattelites at this relatively low orbit means we need a
  fairly regular constellation. In the future, more redundancy in the orbits is
  advised.
* The [RemoteTech][1] flight computer was great. It could precisely execute
  planned maneuvers.
* I had a variety of difficulties with the degree scheme and ordering of
  positions. I'm not sure if this is the "correct" positioning scheme to use
  (relative angular position, in clockwise degrees from a reference object)
