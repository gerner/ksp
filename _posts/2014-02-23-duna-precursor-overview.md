Today we begin a program of missions that to lay the groundwork for long-term
missions on Duna. In particular, over the next two years of game time, we'll
conduct a series of missions during which we'll investigate issues around
safely and reliably sending missions to and from Duna, including sending a
manned mission to Duna, returning safely to Kerbin.

Program Objectives
------------------

###Develop Technology, Experience, Expertise

* Send unmanned and manned missions to and from Duna reliably and safely
* Run missions within the Duna planetary system, including landing on and
  launching from Duna and Ike surfaces
* Run missions within Duna atmosphere and on Duna surface

###Explore Duna Planetary System

* Determine and gain experience with various Duna planetary system orbital
  parameters including sphere of influence bounds, Ike's orbital elements, etc.
* Experiment with and determine appropriate orbital insertion parameters,
  including aerobreaking/aerocapture

###Explore Duna Atmosphere and Duna and Ike Surface

* Determine and gain experience with various atmospheric parameters including
  issues of drag and atmospheric limits
* Determine and gain experience with various topographical parameters including
  altitude distribution
* Explore resource locations
* Identify and explore anomalies
* Scout possible locations for long-term base installations

###Deliver Necessary Equipment

* Plan, build, deliver and install one or  more fuel dump in Duna or Ike orbits
* Land landers on Duna and Ike surface to act as landing beacons for possible
  future landing and/or base sites
* Plan, build, deliver and install base precursor equipment including: power
  generation, optical and scientific instruments, lighting and resource
  gathering

Program Schedule
----------------

While at this time it's impossible to provide a detailed set of mission
schedules, it is possible to provide some high-level milestones, driven by and
overall goal to complete all program objectives in roughly two game years and
the Duna launch windows. These mission sequences will not encompass all
missions during the Duna Precursor Program, but represent time and mission
critical milestones for the program. To that end, we've identified three key
milestones which must be hit on deadline:

1. A first sequence of unmanned missions leaving Kerbin at the first Duna
   launch window
2. A second sequence of unmanned missions leaving Kerbin at the second Duna
   launch window, before any of the first set of missions can return to Kerbin.
   This second sequence will have a more ambitious set of goals than first,
   paving the way for the final sequence of missions.
3. A final sequence of one or more manned missions, and possibly several
   unmanned missions to Duna leaving Kerbin during the third Duna launch
   window, after some of the first unmanned missions return from Duna, but
   before any from the second return.

In addition, thanks to [Alex Moon's launch window
planner][launch-window-planner] we know we get a launch window at about day 57
with a period of 213 days. So we can structure our planning around these
repeating launch windows.

We will detail these three sequences in following posts.
