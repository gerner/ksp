Mission Notes: Launch
---------------------

During this phase we planned for 5000m/s of dV over several minutes ending a
70km by 70km orbit. We expect to get most of that from the lower launch stages
with another 700m/s from the service module.

Initial launch stages went very well. The lower launch stages provided a very
good ascent. We'll only need 130m/s of dV to circularize in a 81km by 81km
orbit. This likely means we hit the 4500m/s to LKO quoted on the wiki. This is
great news, giving us an extra 500m/s of dV for the remaining phases of the
mission.

Mission Notes: Minmus Intercept
-------------------------------

After circularizing, we prepare a 920m/s maneuver node for a Minmus 583km
intercept. After intercept, we have a projected 60km Pe. This is the desired
free-return trajectory. It's not as close as we'll need for SCANSat or Kethane
scanning, but the KeScan has plenty of dV for both polar orbit injection and
any orbital corrections.

At 8410kg and with the 50kN of thrust from the LV-909 we can expect this burn
to take no more than 154 seconds. This is a pretty long burn and we need things
to go fairly precisely in order to get our intercept. I'll shoot to start the
burn at node minus 1 minute and 17 seconds.

Our initial burn got us out to Minmus orbit, but didnt' get us an intercept, so
a second correction burn retrograde just shortly after the first gets us a
flyby at about 500km with a resulting Kerbin Pe of 68km. We'll make another
mid-course correction burn when we get closer to Minmus to get a more inclined
minmus flyby and a closer Pe for Kerbin return. That maneuver is shceduled for
1 day, 8 hours.

Incidentally, while waiting for Minmus Surveyor to intercept Minmus, I swtiched
to KeScan I in Kerbin orbit for some scanning. Everyting went fine until I ran
out of ElectricCharge due to an unexpected Munar eclipse.

We execute the planned maneuver prior to Minmus intercept without difficulty.
We're not 19 hours from SoI change.

Mission Notes: Minmus Flyby
---------------------------

This is going to be the trickiest part of the mission. During our 4.5 hour
flyby of minmus we need to collect science with the science package and put the
KeScan II sattelite into polar orbit. The maneuver we executed on the way to
intercept should give us a highly inclined flyby of minmus, but we'll still
need over 200m/s of dV. The KeScan sattelite has nearly 700m/s which should be
fine for this. With just 3kN of thrust, this is going to be a 70s burn.

During the latest maneuver I already tuned Kerbin Pe for aerocapture. So the
science package technically doesn't need any more burns. I suspect we'll need
another course correction on the way to Kerbin. At least, I'm planning for that
contingency.

On intercept I first decouple KeScan II in order to prep for its polar
injection.

Polar orbit injection went without any difficulties. Although, I was surprised
by how much I noticed the nearly 500ms delay from remote tech. If at minmus
orbit I can tell the difference, I wonder how I'm going to deal with the delay
to Duna.

On the flyby around 350km I'm only able to get "high above minmus" science
readings. In subsequent missions I'll need to get science low above minmus.

Mission Notes: Kerbin Return
----------------------------

The final correction burn I wanted to make did not go as planned. I tried to
use the remote tech flight computer, but unfortunately it failed to make the
burn. However, I was able to manually correct with a couple of manual
maneuvers, retrograde, and prograde.

Kerbin Pe is now 2 days, 22 hours out. In the meantime, I'll do some SCANsat
and Kethane scanning at minmus.

I retract solar panels and the long-range communications dish well before the
first pass through the atmosphere. After the first pass I still have 869 units
of ablative shielding left.

At the start of the second pass Ap is at about 500km, Pe is at about 30km. At
about 10000m we drop the heatshield, deploy landing legs and parachutes.
Landing went according to plan.


Take Aways

* I still find the RemoteTech flight computer unreliable, or at least I don't
  know how to use it.
