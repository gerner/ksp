Objectives
----------

Prior to our first launch window to Duna, we have a launch window to Moho. This
will be a great opportunity to try out interplanetary travel prior to our first
mission to Duna, as well as an opportunity to collect a large amount of
science., as well as an opportunity to collect a large amount of science., as
well as an opportunity to collect a large amount of science., as well as an
opportunity to collect a large amount of science.

* Launch spacecraft away from Kerbin and transfer to Moho
* Land multiple spacecraft on Moho
* Collect and transmit science back to Kerbin

However, we only have about 26 days until the launch window, so we'll need to
carefully coordinate 

Prerequisites
-------------

* Develop long-range communication technology and build such infrastructure
* Develop landing techniques for long-range, high-delay mission
* Supporting launches and infrastructure

Tracks
------

We'll engage three tracks of development to support our mission to Moho:

1. Support: science collection and infrastructure development
2. Spacecraft Testbed: develop the Moho landers and science payload
3. Moho Mission: develop the Moho launch vehicle and transfer craft and
   ultimately conduct the mission to Moho

###Support

In this track we'll collect science and build infrastructure to support the
other tracks. In particular we need to develop and deploy long-range
communication infrastructure, and collect enough science to support development
of Moho landers, launch and transfer craft.

This track has several objectives:

* Transfer crew, life support supplies and a Kerbin return vehicle to SciStat
  in Mun orbit
* Transfer SciStat to Minmus orbit
* Conduct Science missions on Minmus surface to support development of
  necessary mission technology
* Return collected science to Kerbin
* Develop and deploy long-range communication sattelite network capable of
  constant coverage to Moho.

###Testbed

In this track we'll develop and test the Moho landers and other spacecraft. In
particular we need to overcome the very high signal delay we'll face at Moho.
Landing will be very challenging since we will not be able to directly and
interactively control spacecraft at Moho.

* Develop and test Moho lander on both Minmus and the Mun
* Develop automated landing procedure for Moho

We'll try out kOS for the automated landing. In addition we need to decide if
we will try to include a spacecraft for flyby of Moho with return to Kerbin.
The advantage here is that this spacecraft (unlike any satellites or landers)
will not need to inject into an orbit (which will cost over 2000m/s of dV), and
on return we can aerobreak for a landing on Kerbin. In this case we will only
need to alter our trajectory to intercept Kerbin at some point.

###Moho Mission

This track will actually perform the Moho mission, but before that we'll need
to develop and test the Moho launch and transfer vehicles. These vehicles will
need to deliver three landers to Moho as well as a KeScan sattelite into a
polar orbit.

* Develop and test the Moho launch vehicle
* Develop and test the Moho transfer vehicle with transfer and capture at the
  Mun
